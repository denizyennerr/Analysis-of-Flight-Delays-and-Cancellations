### Project Overview
This project analyzes factors influencing flight delays and cancellations by examining flight data, including departure and arrival times, weather conditions, and airline performance. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations to improve the aviation industry's operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction.

### Data Sources

- Airline Flight Delay and Cancellation Data, August 2019 - August 2023 obtained from the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

### Tools
- Python

### Python Libraries
- NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
- Pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- Scikit-learn: A Python machine learning library offering simple and efficient data mining and analysis tools.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Creating a date-time variable for time series analysis and the initial data preparation.
2. Correcting departure and arrival times for data preprocessing.
3. Checking for duplicates to ensure data quality.
4. Cleaning the data in the CSV file for accurate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

- Which airlines show the worst/best performance in terms of delays?
- Does flight performance vary by the month of the year?
- Which routes are most likely to fall into the 1st level delay category?

### Data Analysis

- Creating a categorical variable to understand the relationship between each airline and distance.
- Classifying flight distances into three main groups: distances under 500 miles, distances between 500-1000 miles, and distances of 1000 miles and above.
- Identifying the airlines that perform the most flights.
- Comparing the performance of airlines based on delays.
- Analyzing whether airline performance varies by different months of the year and showing the top 5 best and worst airline performances.
- Determining the percentage of flight cancellations and show how it varies by airline.
- Is there a specific time of day and/or time of year when delay durations are higher?
- Identifying the routes with the highest delay durations.
- Building a machine learning model to predict flight delay durations.
- Evaluation of the model.
