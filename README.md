### Project Overview
The objective of this project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset containing flight information, including departure and arrival times, delays, distances, weather conditions, and airline details. By exploring this data, we aim to identify significant patterns and correlations that contribute to flight delays. This analysis will help to understand the key factors influencing delays, allowing us to develop predictive models and actionable insights to improve airline punctuality and operational efficiency. Through careful data exploration and modeling, this project seeks to support better decision-making for airlines and enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing delays.

### Data Sources
- Airline Flight Delay and Cancellation Data, August 2019 - August 2023 obtained from the US Department of Transportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

### Tools
- Python

### Python Libraries
- NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
- Pandas: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for Python.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Creating a date-time variable for time series analysis and the initial data preparation.
2. Correcting departure and arrival times for data preprocessing.
3. Checking for duplicates to ensure data quality.
4. Cleaning the data in the CSV file for accurate analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

- Which airlines show the worst/best performance in terms of delays?
- Does flight performance vary by the month of the year?
- Which routes are most likely to fall into the 1st level delay category?

### Data Analysis

- Creating a categorical variable to understand the relationship between each airline and distance.
- Classifying flight distances into three main groups: distances under 500 miles, distances between 500-1000 miles, and distances of 1000 miles and above.
- Identifying the airlines that perform the most flights.
- Comparing the performance of airlines based on delays.
- Analyzing whether airline performance varies by different months of the year and showing the top 5 best and worst airline performances.
- Determining the percentage of flight cancellations and show how it varies by airline.
- Is there a specific time of day and/or time of year when delay durations are higher?
- Identifying the routes with the highest delay durations.

- Departure and arrival times were corrected to ensure the accuracy of the data.
- Duplicates were checked to identify any inconsistencies or repeated information within the dataset.
- A logical relationship between weather variables and flight delays was investigated.
- Cleaning and organizing the data from the CSV file.
- Identified which airlines perform the worst in terms of delays.
- Determined which airlines perform the best.
- Analyzed whether flight performance varies by month, whether a certain airline consistently performs poorly, or if performance fluctuates.
- Identified which routes have the highest probability of falling into the level 1 delay category.
  
A date-time index was generated for Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, enabling more effective visualization and time series analysis.
```Python
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df[['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute']])
df.insert(0, 'date', df.pop('date'))
df.drop(columns=['year', 'month', 'day','hour', 'minute'], inplace=True)
df['sched_dep_time'] = df['sched_dep_time'].astype(str).str.zfill(4)
df['sched_dep_time']= pd.to_datetime(df['sched_dep_time'], format="%H%M").dt.time.astype(str).str[:5]
